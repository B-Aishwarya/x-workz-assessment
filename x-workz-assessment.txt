1.What is the difference between compile time and runtime?
 -> Compile time is when the program is compiled, where source code is converted into an executable code.
 -> runtime is when it executes (on either a physical or virtual computer). 
  
  
2.Explain types of variables with example.
 -> A variable is a name which is associated with a value that can be changed 
   there are two types of variables 
   a) Local variable = Local variable is a variable declared inside a method and also accesible inside the method that declare it. you can declare them at start of the program within main method insiade class.
   b) Class variables also known as static variables are declared with the static keyword in a class, but outside a method.
   
3.Explain method, parameter, argument and return types with example
->    a) Method- Method is collection of statements, which is used to perform logic or used to write code and also it is used to reuse statements.
      b) parameter-Parameter act as a variable inside the method name inside paranthesis. 
	  c) Argument- Argument- is a variable passed to the method when a parameter is passed to the method it is argument.
	  d) Return type -Defines the datatype of the value returned from a method, stores values returns from method , we declare method return type in its method declaration.
	  
4.What is Encapsulation? Explain with an example
->Where we hide the data members means field, using access specifiers we achieve encapsulation in java.
-> It consist of get() and set() where get()it allow  to only read the data from outside class but not to accessand set() is used to change the value.
  
5.Explain array with example.
->An Arrayis a datastructure which can store the collection of element of the similar datatypes.

6.Explain Method overloading with two example?
->Two methods having same signature but different parameter is called method overloading.
